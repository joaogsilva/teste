### Risk Calculate
The risk is calculated based on the formula below and it is measured to identify risks in production environments.

| Item Weights |
| ------------ |
| 0, 1 or 2    |

| Calculation                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk = \[(a0 \* t0) + (a1 \* t1) + (ai \* ti) + ... + (an \* tn)\]/n |

*Where:*

*i: item index*

*ai: item answer based on item weight (0 if "Not satisfied"; 1 if "Partially satisfied"; 2 if "Totally satisfied")*

*ti: item answer multiplicator (1 if "Not satisfied"; 0,5 if "Partially satisfied"; 0 if "Totally satisfied")*

*n: number of applicable items*
